## Overview:
In Redclif, you play as Arjun, an astronaut stranded on Mars after a mission to investigate a lost expedition goes horribly wrong. With your spacecraft damaged and limited resources, you must explore the harsh Martian landscape, uncover the fate of the previous mission, and find a way to repair your ship before your oxygen runs out.

## Key Features:
Survival Mechanics: Manage limited resources, including oxygen and health, while battling the Martian environment.
Exploration: Traverse the barren Martian surface, eerie caves, and the remnants of the lost expedition’s base camp.
Puzzle Solving: Repair your spacecraft, uncover secrets, and piece together the mystery of the missing crew.
Hand-Drawn Art: Beautifully crafted 2 visuals that bring the desolation of Mars to life.
Story: After a crash landing on Mars, Arjun discovers the energy core of his ship is broken, and his chances of survival are slim. As he explores the planet, he uncovers the remnants of a previous mission, including a time-manipulating entity that rewinds events. The stakes are high—escape before time resets again, or be trapped forever in a deadly loop.
